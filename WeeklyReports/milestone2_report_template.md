Group C
Date: April 8, 2019
Class: 13.1

## About this Milestone 

At this point, you should have base research done on the technologies to use and have your workflow in place. Your focus this week should be on building and developing your program. Next Monday will be Milestone 3, where you will demonstrate your app to the professor. You will need to describe the parts that members contributed. The app will not have to be fully integrated for Milestone 3, but does need to be a working minimally viable product by Milestone 4 for class play test. 

## Questions to Answer for Milestone 2

### Do you have your technologies/SDKs researched? 

List technologies here as well as anything requires further research:

### What is the vision for the application you are committing to for the next milestone?

A working archery mechanic with target hitting working.
Being able to interact with the scene already created in this milestone.

### Do you have a workflow in place? 

We are using the settings in GitHub to manage the team's workflow.

### Do you have a common project started?

Yes. We have a Unity project in GitHub that already has everyone added. The project has an almost-built scene and some utility of moving targets.

### Do you have major blocking issues at this time? 

Our main issue as of now is getting the mixed reality headset to  work with SteamVR.

### How will you be employing sound? 

On arrow draw there will be a sound.
On arrow release there will be a sound.
On arrow hit there will be a sound.
There will be ambient sound throughout the level. Some ideas would be wind or birds, maybe water if we decide to add water to the scene.
